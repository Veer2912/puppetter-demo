I have used puppeteer module to make a demo project that tests the website "https://www.calculator.net/". 
Script should perform following actions:
          1.click on buttons in calculator interface on the site to add 89 and 32.
          2.show the result 121 that shows up in the calculator result section in the console.
I used the following documentations:
   1. "https://pptr.dev/guides/getting-started"
   2. "https://www.browserless.io/blog/record-puppeteer-scripts"
